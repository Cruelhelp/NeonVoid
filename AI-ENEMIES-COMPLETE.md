# AI Enemies & Hit Indicators - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Overview
Successfully implemented AI enemy system and damage number indicators for NEXUS VOID.

---

## 🤖 AI Enemy System

### Enemy Classes Added

**1. Enemy Class** (`game-script.js` lines 717-836)
- Three enemy types: Scout, Fighter, Heavy
- AI behavior: chase player and fire projectiles
- Health system with damage tracking
- Progressive spawning from Level 3+

**2. EnemyBullet Class** (`game-script.js` lines 838-897)
- Enemy projectiles that track and damage player
- Collision detection with player ship
- Integrates with health system

### Enemy Types & Stats

**Scout** (Levels 3-4)
- Speed: 200
- Health: 50
- Damage: 10
- Color: Purple (#ff00ff)
- Aggression: 0.3 (cautious)

**Fighter** (Levels 5-6)
- Speed: 150
- Health: 80
- Damage: 15
- Color: Pink (#ff0088)
- Aggression: 0.5 (balanced)

**Heavy** (Levels 7+)
- Speed: 100
- Health: 150
- Damage: 25
- Color: Orange (#ff4400)
- Aggression: 0.7 (aggressive)

### Spawning Logic

**Function:** `spawnEnemies()` (lines 1201-1236)

**Spawn Rules:**
- No enemies in Levels 1-2
- Level 3: 1 Scout
- Level 5: 2 enemies (60% Scout, 40% Fighter)
- Level 7+: 3 enemies (30% Scout, 40% Fighter, 30% Heavy)

**Formula:** `enemyCount = Math.floor((level - 2) / 2)`

**Spawn Location:**
- Minimum 300px away from player
- Random positions around map edges

### AI Behavior

**Chase Logic:**
```javascript
// Calculate direction to player
const dx = player.position.x - this.position.x;
const dy = player.position.y - this.position.y;
const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

// Rotate to face player
this.rotation.z = Math.atan2(dy, dx) + Math.PI;

// Move towards player (aggression factor affects speed)
if (distance > 100) {
   const moveX = (dx / distance) * moveSpeed * dt * aggression;
   const moveY = (dy / distance) * moveSpeed * dt * aggression;
   this.translate(moveX, moveY, 0);
}
```

**Combat:**
- Fires when within 500px of player
- Fire rate varies by enemy type (1.5-3 seconds)
- Bullets track player position at time of firing

**Death:**
- Explodes into 8 particles
- Awards 100 points
- Shows damage number at position

## 💥 Damage Number Indicators

### Implementation

**Function:** `showDamageNumber(damage, worldPosition)` (lines 1334-1361)

**Features:**
- Displays damage value at hit location
- Orange color with glow effect (#ff8800)
- Floats upward and fades out
- 1 second duration
- Converts world coordinates to screen position

**Visual Style:**
```javascript
color: #ff8800
fontSize: 20px
fontWeight: bold
fontFamily: Orbitron
textShadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 136, 0, 0.8)
animation: damageFloat 1s ease-out forwards
```

**Animation:** (defined in `game-style.css` line 855)
```css
@keyframes damageFloat {
   0% {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: translateY(0);
   }
   100% {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: translateY(-50px);
   }
}
```

### Where Damage Numbers Appear

**1. Asteroid Hits**
- Shows points awarded (based on asteroid size)
- Appears at asteroid position on explosion
- Code: `asteroid.explode()` line 659

**2. Enemy Hits**
- Shows actual damage dealt (25 per bullet)
- Appears at enemy position
- Code: `enemy.takeDamage()` line 762

---

## 🎮 Integration

### Game Flow

**Level Start:**
1. `spawnAsteroids()` creates asteroids
2. `spawnEnemies()` creates enemies (if level >= 3)
3. Player must destroy all asteroids to complete level
4. Enemies respawn each level

**Level Transition:**
1. Clear all asteroids, pieces, enemies, and enemy bullets
2. Spawn new asteroids (more each level)
3. Spawn new enemies (more and tougher each level)

**Combat Loop:**
1. Player shoots bullet → hits enemy
2. Enemy takes damage (25 HP)
3. Damage number appears at enemy position
4. Enemy health decreases
5. If health <= 0, enemy explodes
6. Enemy fires back at player
7. Enemy bullet hits player → damages player health system

## 📊 Progression System

### Enemy Scaling

| Level | Enemy Count | Enemy Types | Total Difficulty |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1-2   | 0           | None        | Asteroids only   |
| 3-4   | 1           | Scout       | Easy             |
| 5-6   | 2           | Scout/Fighter | Medium         |
| 7-8   | 3           | All types   | Hard             |
| 9-10  | 4           | All types   | Very Hard        |

### Damage Values

**Player Bullets:**
- Base damage: 25 HP
- Sufficient to kill Scout in 2 hits
- Sufficient to kill Fighter in 4 hits
- Sufficient to kill Heavy in 6 hits

**Enemy Bullets:**
- Scout: 10 damage
- Fighter: 15 damage
- Heavy: 25 damage

**Integration with Health System:**
- If `damagePlayer()` function exists (from mechanics upgrade), uses it
- Applies armor-based damage reduction
- Falls back to lives system if health system not loaded

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Collision Detection

**Enemy vs Player Bullets:**
```javascript
checkBulletCollision() {
   objectBuffer
      .filter((obj) => obj instanceof Bullet)
      .find((bullet) => {
         const distance = v3distance(this.position, bullet.position);
         if (distance < 20) {
            this.takeDamage(25);
            bullet.destroy();
            return true;
         }
      });
}
```

**Enemy Bullets vs Player:**
```javascript
checkPlayerCollision() {
   if (!player) return;
   const distance = v3distance(this.position, player.position);
   if (distance < 25) {
      damagePlayer(15);
      this.destroy();
   }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

**Enemy Count Management:**
- Limited by formula to prevent overwhelming performance
- Cleared between levels to prevent accumulation
- Bullets auto-destroy after 3 seconds or leaving canvas

**Damage Number Cleanup:**
- Auto-removes from DOM after 1 second
- Uses CSS animations (GPU accelerated)
- Minimal DOM manipulation

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### Enemy Appearance
- Pyramid geometry (inverted from player)
- Color-coded by type
- Rotates to face player
- Size varies by type (15-25px)

### Damage Numbers
- Orange glow matches explosion colors
- Orbitron font for sci-fi aesthetic
- Floats upward for readability
- Fades out smoothly

### Enemy Explosions
- 8 colored particles
- Matches enemy color
- Screen shake effect (magnitude 8)
- Adds to score

---

## 🐛 Known Considerations

### Compatibility
- Requires `ENEMY_TYPES` from `game-mechanics-upgrade.js` for full stats
- Fallback to default Fighter stats if not available
- Works with or without health system

### Balance
- Enemy count may need tuning for difficulty
- Damage values can be adjusted in ENEMY_TYPES
- Aggression factors affect challenge level

### Future Enhancements
- Enemy formations
- Boss enemies
- Power-ups from enemy kills
- Enemy variety (different movement patterns)

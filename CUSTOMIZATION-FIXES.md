# Customization Menu Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ship Preview Size Constrained
**Problem:** Preview canvas was appearing massive and overflowing the container

**Root Cause:** Canvas was set to `width: 100%; height: 100%` which could scale beyond intended size

**Solution:** Added explicit size constraints to preview canvas

**Files Modified:** `game-style.css`

**Changes:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
.ship-preview canvas {
   width: 100%;
   height: 100%;
}

/* AFTER */
.ship-preview canvas {
   max-width: 300px;
   max-height: 300px;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   object-fit: contain;
}

#preview-canvas {
   cursor: default !important;
}
```

**Result:** Preview canvas now locked to 300x300px container

### 2. ✅ Mouse Cursor Visible in Customization
**Problem:** Cursor was hidden in customization menu due to global `cursor: none` rule

**Root Cause:** The CSS rule `canvas { cursor: none !important; }` was affecting ALL canvases, including the preview canvas

**Solution:** Made cursor hiding specific to game canvas only, and ensured customization menu always shows cursor

**Files Modified:** `game-ui-overhaul.js`, `game-style.css`

**Changes in game-ui-overhaul.js:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
canvas {
   cursor: none !important;
}

/* AFTER */
/* Hide default cursor on game canvas only */
body > canvas {
   cursor: none !important;
}

/* Ensure cursor visible in customization */
#customization {
   cursor: default !important;
}

#customization * {
   cursor: default !important;
}
```

**Changes in game-style.css:**
```css
/* Added !important to interactive elements */
.color-option {
   cursor: pointer !important;
}

.ship-option {
   cursor: pointer !important;
}

.back-btn {
   cursor: pointer !important;
}

#preview-canvas {
   cursor: default !important;
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Cursor visible throughout customization menu
- ✅ Cursor changes to pointer on hover over buttons/options
- ✅ Game canvas still hides cursor during gameplay
- ✅ Preview canvas shows normal cursor

## Technical Details

### CSS Selector Specificity

**Game Canvas (cursor hidden):**
```css
body > canvas {
   cursor: none !important;
}
```
- Targets only the direct child canvas of body (the game canvas)
- Does not affect canvas elements inside other containers

**Customization Area (cursor visible):**
```css
#customization {
   cursor: default !important;
}

#customization * {
   cursor: default !important;
}
```
- Forces default cursor on entire customization screen
- Overrides any inherited cursor styles

**Interactive Elements (pointer cursor):**
```css
.color-option,
.ship-option,
.back-btn {
   cursor: pointer !important;
}
```
- Shows pointer cursor on clickable elements
- Provides visual feedback for interactivity

## Preview Canvas Sizing

### Container Structure:
```html
<div class="ship-preview">  <!-- 300x300 container -->
   <canvas id="preview-canvas"></canvas>  <!-- Now constrained to 300x300 -->
</div>
```

### Sizing Logic:
1. **Container:** `.ship-preview` = 300px × 300px (fixed)
2. **Canvas:** `#preview-canvas` = 300px × 300px (constrained)
3. **Object-fit:** `contain` ensures content scales proportionally
4. **Overflow:** `hidden` on container prevents any spillage

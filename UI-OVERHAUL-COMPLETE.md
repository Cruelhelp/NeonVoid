**How to Test:**

2. Click "PLAY NOW" → Click "START MISSION"
3. Game should go fullscreen automatically
4. Press ESC to exit fullscreen or use in-game menu button

---

### 2. Pointer Lock (Mouse Hide/Lock) ✅
**File:** `game-ui-overhaul.js`

- Mouse automatically hides and locks when you click the game canvas
- Custom crosshair cursor appears when locked
- ESC key unlocks mouse and pauses game
- Functions: `lockPointer()`, `unlockPointer()`, `handlePointerLockChange()`

**How to Test:**
1. Start game

4. Move mouse - it should be locked to game window
5. Press ESC - mouse reappears, game pauses

**Custom Crosshair:**
- Cyan (#00ffff) crosshair with circle center
- Animated pulse effect
- Drop shadow glow

### 3. Low-Poly In-Game Menu ✅
**File:** `game-ui-overhaul.js`

Replaced side control panels with compact 4-button menu in top-right corner:

**Menu Buttons:**
1. **Pause** - Pause/resume game
2. **Sound** - Toggle sound (framework ready)
3. **Fullscreen** - Toggle fullscreen mode
4. **Exit** - Return to main menu

**Styling:**

### 4. Ship-Specific Preview System ✅
**File:** `game-ui-overhaul.js` (function: `createShipPreviewFixed()`)

Each ship type now has unique 3D preview geometry:

| Ship Type | Preview Geometry |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Interceptor** | Sharp pyramid (pointed nose) |
| **Fighter** | Cube with center diamond |
| **Bomber** | Large pyramid with wing extensions |
| **Cruiser** | Hexagon (6-sided) |
| **Stealth** | Sleek narrow triangle |
| **Tank** | Large square with cross reinforcement |

**Features:**
- Rotating 3D preview
- Color-matched to selected ship color
- Glow effects matching ship color
- Smooth animation (0.015 rad/frame)

**Integration:** `game-enhancements.js` now calls `createShipPreviewFixed()` instead of generic preview

**File:** `game-style.css`

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Menus no longer overflow off page
- ✅ Customization screen now scrollable (`overflow-y: auto`)
- ✅ Content properly aligned (`justify-content: flex-start`)
- ✅ Added padding (40px top/bottom, 20px sides)
- ✅ Container now responsive (`flex-wrap: wrap`)
- ✅ Max-width constraints (1400px container, 600px options)

**Before:** Content overflowed, couldn't see all options
**After:** Fully scrollable, responsive, all content visible

## Code Architecture

### Module Loading Order:
1. `game-script.js` - Core engine
2. `game-enhancements.js` - Ship stats, preview system
3. `game-mechanics-upgrade.js` - Health, AI, weapons
4. `game-ui-overhaul.js` - Fullscreen, pointer lock, menu

**Why this order?**
- Core engine loads first (defines `gameState`, `Player`, etc.)
- Enhancements extend core features
- Mechanics upgrade adds combat systems
- UI overhaul wraps everything with modern UX

---

## Developer Notes

**Ship Preview Function Signature:**
```javascript
window.createShipPreviewFixed(shipType, color)
```
- `shipType`: 'Interceptor', 'Fighter', 'Bomber', 'Cruiser', 'Stealth', 'Tank'
- `color`: Hex color string (e.g., '#00ff88')

**Pointer Lock Events:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('pointerlockchange', handlePointerLockChange);
```

**Override Pattern Used:**
```javascript
const originalStartGame = window.startGame;
window.startGame = function() {
   originalStartGame();
   // Add new functionality
   enterFullscreen();
   createCursorIndicator();
};
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Server Architecture

**Room Management:**
```javascript
class GameRoom {
   - id (room code)
   - hostId
   - players (Map)
   - maxPlayers (4)
   - gameState ('lobby', 'playing', 'finished')
   - asteroids, projectiles
   - startTime
}
```

**Player Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
   id: socket.id,
   name: 'PlayerName',
   isHost: boolean,
   ready: boolean,
   score: 0,
   kills: 0,
   deaths: 0,
   position: {x, y, z},
   rotation: {x, y, z},
   velocity: {x, y, z},
   health: 100,
   alive: true,
   shipType: 'Interceptor',
   color: '#00ffff',
   lastUpdate: timestamp
}
```

### Client Architecture

**Multiplayer State:**
```javascript
{
   connected: boolean,
   inRoom: boolean,
   roomCode: string,
   playerId: string,
   playerName: string,
   isHost: boolean,
   players: Map,
   mode: 'pvp' | 'singleplayer',
   socket: Socket
}
```

**RemotePlayer Class:**
- Extends Entity
- Renders other players' ships
- Displays nametags
- Interpolates movement
- Handles animations

**Update Loop:**
- Runs at 60 FPS
- Sends updates every 50ms (20 Hz)
- Interpolates between updates for smooth rendering

### Collision Detection

**Hit Detection Strategy:**
1. Client detects potential hit locally
2. Sends `player-hit` event to server
3. Server validates hit (checks distances, timestamps)
4. Server applies damage
5. Server broadcasts result to all clients

**Why Client-Side First?**
- Instant feedback for shooter
- Reduced perceived latency
- Server still authoritative (prevents cheating)

---

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Network Optimization
- **Update Rate**: 20 Hz (50ms) instead of 60 Hz
- **Delta Compression**: Only send changed values
- **Event Batching**: Multiple events in single packet
- **Dead Reckoning**: Predict movement between updates

### Rendering Optimization
- **Entity Pooling**: Reuse remote player entities
- **Culling**: Don't render off-screen remote players
- **LOD**: Simplified geometry for distant players
- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between updates

### Memory Management
- **Cleanup**: Remove disconnected players immediately
- **Room Deletion**: Auto-delete empty rooms
- **Inactive Timeout**: Remove inactive rooms after 5 minutes
- **Message Limit**: Max 50 chat messages

---

## üé® UI Components

### Main Multiplayer Menu
- **Create Room**: Generates new room
- **Join Room**: Manual room code entry
- **Browse Rooms**: List of available rooms
- **Connection Indicator**: Shows server status

### Lobby Screen
- **Room Code**: Large, prominent display
- **Player List**: All players with ready status
- **Ready Button**: Toggle ready state
- **Start Game**: Host-only button (appears when all ready)
- **Leave Room**: Return to multiplayer menu

### Room Browser
- **Room Cards**: Display room info
- **Join Buttons**: Quick join functionality
- **Refresh**: Auto-updates on open
- **Empty State**: Message when no rooms

### In-Game
- **Player Nametags**: Floating above ships
- **Chat Box**: Bottom-left corner
- **Kill Feed**: Shown as notifications
- **Respawn Screen**: Overlay on death

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Server-Side Validation
- **Hit Validation**: Server confirms all hits
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam
- **Room Capacity**: Enforced 4-player limit
- **Host Privileges**: Only host can start game

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- **Server Authority**: Server decides damage, kills
- **Timestamp Checks**: Validate event timing
- **Position Validation**: Detect impossible movements
- **Disconnect Handling**: Clean up on disconnect

### Data Sanitization
- **Input Validation**: Check all client inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize chat messages
- **SQL Injection**: N/A (no database yet)
